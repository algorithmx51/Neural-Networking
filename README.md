# An incomplete implementation of neural networks in C++

In the src (source) directory there are 2 files
	
## [neat.h](https://github.com/algorithmx51/Neural-Networking/blob/master/src/neat.h)

This is the main header file, you can include it to your code by typing #include"neat.h"

Note : Tested on : Windows 10 , Kali Linux 5.6.0 | You have to install the graphics.h library into your OS

## [headless-neat.h](https://github.com/algorithmx51/Neural-Networking/blob/master/src/headless-neat.h)

This is a copy of neat.h that is used by systems that do not support graphics.h library

Note : Tested on : Windows 10
